                            As a Software Developer, I was responsible for developing features end to end to production using Python, Django, JavaScript and AWS.
                            I also developed a new test coverage template and significantly increased test coverage by writing over 200+ test cases.

                            As a Software Engineer, I wrote Python scripts to connect IoT devices to AWS and architected a new Amazon DynamoDB schema to optimize and improve query performance.
