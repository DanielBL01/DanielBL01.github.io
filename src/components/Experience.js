                            As a Backend Developer, I worked with technologies such as Java, Kafka, Docker, Shell and CentOS. During 
                            my term, I developed a common HTTP client library in Java to connect our team project to microservices. I also
                            revamped our Kafka setup procedure to reduce file generation time.

                            As a Software Developer, I delivered some exciting features to our IoT device control platform to production. This also
                            included writing Lambda functions on AWS to store event data from API Gateway to DynamoDB and streaming data from DynamoDB
                            in real-time using jQuery and Ajax to display to clients.

                            As a Software Engineer, I architected a new DynamoDB schema using the primary key and global secondary index feature to improve
                            query flexibility and performance. I also wrote some Python scripts to connect IoT devices to AWS IoT Core.
