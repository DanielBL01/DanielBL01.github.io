# Personal Website
This is my personal website source code. Built using React and deployed to Heroku with a custom domain which I
bought from Namecheap :)

TODO LIST:
1. Add Redux for performance optimization
2. Add hamburger menu for mobile
3. Create nightmode option
4. Add a Learn section talking about algorithms and data structures (with code snippets)
