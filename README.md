# Personal Website
This is my personal website source code. Built using React and deployed to Heroku with a custom domain which I
bought from Namecheap :)

Currently / thinking about working on:
1. Adding Redux to optimize performance
2. Creating nightmode option
3. Making sure the header text is responsive
4. Updating the Learn section with more content and code :)
